- camon prints lines even when they do not change. This can happen when the precision more coarse than the MDEL field. Thus the client gets monitor updates but they all round to the same string.
My version suppresses this noise. Only when the output actually changes it is printed. This may be with the same value string if time stamps are printed too or if the alarm status changes.
